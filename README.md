 Recursive and Non-Recursive Functions

 Overview
This project contains solutions for a set of computational problems, some of which require recursion. Each problem is implemented as a function in Python.

Problems and Solutions

Problem 1: Find the Minimum Value
Given a number `n` and an array of `n` elements, return the minimum value.

 Problem 2: Find the Average
Given a number `n` and an array of `n` elements, return the average value.

 Problem 3: Check for Primality
Given a number `n`, determine if it is prime.

 Problem 4: Compute Factorial (Recursive)
Given `n`, compute `n!` using recursion.

Problem 5: Compute Fibonacci Number (Recursive)
Given `n`, find the `n`-th Fibonacci number using recursion.

Problem 6: Compute Power (Recursive)
Given numbers `a` and `n`, compute `a^n` using recursion.

Problem 7: Reverse an Array (Recursive)
Given `n` and an array of `n` elements, return the array in reverse order without using an array data structure (recursion required).

Problem 8: Check If a String Contains Only Digits
Given a string `s`, check if all its characters are digits.

 Problem 9: Compute Binomial Coefficient (Recursive)
Given `n` and `k`, compute `C(n, k)` using recursion.

 Problem 10: Compute GCD Using Recursion
Given numbers `a` and `b`, find `GCD(a, b)` using the Euclidean Algorithm recursively.

 Usage
Each function is implemented in a separate Python file and can be executed individually by calling the function with the required inputs.
